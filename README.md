# Eat Drywall Piano Player
 A piano autoplayer made in AHK for the funny roblox game named "Eat Drywall" (Sorry for how bad this README is I don't like explaining things)

# How to use
 There are 2 different versions in this repo. PianoExp.ahk is the one you'll wanna use (It's the "experimental" version AKA the one i'm actually updating)

To load a song make sure there is a folder named "Songs" in the same directory as the script (Folder included has all the song files i've made for testing). Input the filename of the song you wish to load into the first Text field and the NPS (Notes Per Second) in the second then just hit the load button. When you wanna play it just click play and switch to roblox!
